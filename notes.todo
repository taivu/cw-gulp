# Front End Workflow

Styles:
  ☐ look into postCSS to replace gulp-sass.
  ☐ look into stylefmt to fix styles automagically.
  ☐ look into plugins to reorder properties

Thoughts/Research Topics:
  ☐ could this be a base for drupal theming?
  ☐ git clone workflow
  ☐ what things should not be in this gulp file? (stylefmt?)
  ☐ look into synchronously running tasks. (Gulp 4)?
  ☐ can all this be run as npm scripts?
  ☐ changelog.md?
  ☐ ES6 support via babel?
  ☐ pattern-lab integration?
